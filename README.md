# Data Engineering Project using Git and Docker
What we are planning to work on is a project around time series prediction, mainly the prediction of oil prices.

## Git usage
We will be using Git and Github for version control, and collaborating with each other inside this repo

## Docker usage
We will have many containers responsible for different tasks and pipelines:
1. Data Preparation for Machine Learning task
2. Model Training (Different time steps for each training)
3. Inference to test the models on new data points
